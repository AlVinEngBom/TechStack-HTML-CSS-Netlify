            <h2>What are Seals?</h2>
            
            <p>Pinnipeds, commonly known as seals, are a widely distributed and diverse clade of carnivorous, 
                fin-footed, semiaquatic, mostly marine mammals. They comprise the extant families Odobenidae 
                (whose only living member is the walrus), Otariidae (the eared seals: sea lions and fur seals),
                 and Phocidae (the earless seals, or true seals). There are 34 extant species of pinnipeds, 
                 and more than 50 extinct species have been described from fossils. While seals were historically
                  thought to have descended from two ancestral lines, molecular evidence supports them as a 
                  monophyletic lineage (descended from one ancestral line). Pinnipeds belong to the order 
                  Carnivora; their closest living relatives are bears and the superfamily of musteloids 
                  (weasels, raccoons, skunks, and red pandas), having diverged about 50 million years ago.

            <h2>Protect the chonks</h2>

            <p>Hunting. Human greed has led to the decline of many seal populations. 
                In the past, millions of seals were killed for their valuable meat, 
                blubber, and pelts. In some countries seals are still killed in large 
                numbers because fishermen blame them for the decline in fish.</p>
